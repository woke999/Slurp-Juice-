# Slurp Juice+
Slurp Juice+ is Slurp Juice recoded, using a new text editor, a new api, and new UI

# Why choose Slurp Juice?
* Alot of free lua executors have viruses, but since this is open source there's no way for it to have a virus
* Open source, you can contribute to it or create your own executor based off of the code base
* For C# developers, the code base is mostly very clean, use classes for most things to keep the main source file very short and readable
